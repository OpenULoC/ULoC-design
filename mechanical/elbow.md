## Design 1

[Files](elbow1)

A sturdy elbow with 3D printed gear bearings.
It's designed to connect two M5 threaded rods,
plus using a few M3 nots and bolts in its build.
All remaining components can be 3D printed.

The design has been built, and unfortunately
the printed gear bearings quickly fail.

## Design 2
Work in progress, will use cheap ball bearings.
